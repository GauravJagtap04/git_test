# To-do App
The To-Do App is an interactive and user-friendly website designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this website leverages LocalStorage to provide a persistent and personalized task management experience.


## Features
### Task Management 
Users can add and delete tasks. Each task can be assigned a priority level (e.g., high, medium, low) to help with organization.

### Task Completion Tracking 
Users can mark tasks as completed, and these tasks are visually distinguished from pending ones for easy tracking. Users can even track the time when the task was added and when it was completed by hovering the mouse over the task.

### LocalStorage Integration 
The app stores all tasks, including their statuses and priorities, in LocalStorage, ensuring that tasks are saved even after the browser is closed or refreshed.

### Dynamic UI 
The interface dynamically updates as tasks are added or removed, without needing to refresh the page.

### Responsive Design 
The app is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on devices of all sizes, from smartphones to desktops.
